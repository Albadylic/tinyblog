Eleventy is a static site generator

I'd used it at Founders and Coders but never to build a site from scratch

I wanted to create a simple blog and portfolio site, so I chose to go with 11ty

Their resources are brilliant, a [6 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzf9A9tkkl4) on building a blog from scratch... hot dog!

Getting up and running was very quick, with only a few minor hiccups on the way. What's great about it is how easy it is to create and customise layouts and then to be able to create sleek and uniform pages in only a few minutes.
